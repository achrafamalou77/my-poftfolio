TL;DR
This site is built for speed and privacy. I don’t track you, I don't use cookies, and since I've removed the chatbot, no conversation data is ever stored.

Hey 👋
I'm Achraf Amalou, a software engineering student at USTHB. This website is my personal portfolio where I showcase my projects and professional journey. I value the privacy of my visitors, so I’ve kept this policy as simple as possible.

What I collect (and why)
This site is a static Next.js application. There are no user accounts, no third-party advertisements, and no tracking scripts monitoring your behavior.

Analytics
I do not use invasive tracking. Any basic site-visit metrics are handled through Vercel's privacy-focused analytics, which do not collect personal identifiable information.

Contacting me
If you reach out to me via the contact form or email, I will only use your information to:

Respond to your inquiry.

Discuss potential collaborations or freelance opportunities.

Data Usage
I do not sell, trade, or rent any information to third parties. Any data you share through a direct message is used solely to communicate with you.
